Need to be keen while loading MATLAB files (the one with. mlx extension) in the MATLAB program: -

##### Setting up rng (random number generator) 
  Sometimes errors may pop after loading the files which may hinder the entire program from running as usual.
  
•	It may be caused by changing the name of the file or location of the file

•	How to solve this problem – create a new live script file, save it in your local computer, then put the STUDENTID as follows rng(123456789), run the section by                              
    pressing F5,copy paste into the file, and save.

•	The program contains heavy data. You need to be patient and avoid unnecessary interruptions. 

###	NB: THE FILE MAY TAKE A WHILE; PLEASE ENSURE YOU ARE RUNNING ON HIGHER PROCESSING COMPUTER AND ALL OTHER PROGRAMS ARE CLOSED TO GIVE SPACE FOR THE FILE TO LOAD AND OUPUT DATA CORRECTLY AND FASTER
